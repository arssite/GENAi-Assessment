# GENAi-Assessment
Repo contains my internship assessment, focusing on a RAG model and an Interactive QA bot interface. The RAG model retrieves document embeddings via a vector database and generates answers using a generative model. The interface allows users to upload documents and get real-time answers. It includes code, a Colab, Docker deployment instructions.
